# Fitness-Program-Generator
This is a weight lifting program generator and it is also my first attempt of creating an application.

This program is a workout program generator. The workout program consists of the use of free weights and body weight exercise routines. The user will be prompted to enter information regarding an initial consultation. The initial consultation includes personal strength and body stats, such as: Body weight, height, exercise experience, goals. Depending on the credentials of the user, a workout plan will be generated that specifies: Various exercises, number of reps, intensity level of exercise, rest periods in between sets, and frequency. Three workout programs focus will be generated (strength and building muscle, power/athletic performance, toned/maintenance) depending on the goals of the client. When it comes to the details and numbers of each workout goal, it will depend on the clientâ€™s experience level, body weight, and height). Also, the exercises listed below need to be organized manually. I never got around to organizing the exercises performed in a weekly schedule for the user.
